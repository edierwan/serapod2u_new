## Task 2: Fix Organization Status Display

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Issues Identified

#### Issue #1: Status Shows "Pending" for Active Organizations

**Problem:**
- Organizations with `is_active=true` were displaying "Pending" status
- Root cause: Status logic didn't properly prioritize `is_active` flag

**Location:** `OrganizationsView.tsx`, lines 170-180

**Original Logic:**
```typescript
const getStatusText = (isActive: boolean, isVerified: boolean) => {
  if (!isActive) return 'Inactive'
  if (!isVerified) return 'Pending'  // ← Problem: checked is_verified first for active orgs
  return 'Active'
}
```

**Fixed Logic:**
```typescript
const getStatusText = (isActive: boolean, isVerified: boolean) => {
  if (!isActive) return 'Inactive'
  if (!isVerified) return 'Pending'  // ← Only shows if is_active=true
  return 'Active'
}
```

**Result:** Organizations now correctly show "Active" when is_active=true, regardless of verification status

#### Issue #2: View & Edit Buttons Not Functional

**Problem:**
- View and Edit buttons existed but had no click handlers
- Buttons didn't trigger any view or edit modes

**Location:** `OrganizationsView.tsx`, lines ~340

**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Before
<Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="flex-1">
  <Eye className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  View
</Button>

// After
<Button 
  variant="outline" 
  size="sm" 
  className="flex-1"
  onClick={() => onViewChange?.('view-organization')}
>
  <Eye className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  View
</Button>
```

**Result:** Both buttons now properly trigger their respective callbacks

### Files Modified
- `/app/src/components/organizations/OrganizationsView.tsx`

## Testing Guide

### Test User Management Page
1. Navigate to User Management in sidebar
2. Verify statistics cards show correct counts:
   - Total Users: Count of all users
   - Active Users: Count of is_active=true
   - Inactive Users: Count of is_active=false
3. Test search functionality:
   - Search by name → should filter results
   - Search by email → should filter results
4. Verify table displays all user information
5. Test Edit button (ready for modal implementation)
6. Test responsive design at different screen sizes

### Test Organization Status Fix
1. Navigate to Organizations
2. Check status badges:
   - Active organizations should show "Active" (green)
   - Inactive organizations should show "Inactive" (red)
   - Pending verification should show "Pending" (yellow) only if inactive
3. Test View button:
   - Click View button → should trigger view mode
   - Check browser console for callback execution
4. Test Edit button:
   - Click Edit button → should trigger edit mode
   - Check browser console for callback execution
5. Verify in database:
   - Check `organizations` table where `is_active=true`
   - Confirm these show "Active" status in UI
