## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/serapod2u_new
supabase db push
```
**Verify:** Column `image_url` exists in `product_variants`

### Step 2: Check Storage Bucket
**In Supabase Dashboard:**
- Navigate to Storage
- Verify `avatars` bucket exists
- Ensure bucket is PUBLIC
- Check RLS policies allow authenticated uploads

### Step 3: Build & Test
```bash
cd app
npm run build
```
**Expected:** No TypeScript errors, clean build

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Create Variant with Image
1. Click "Add Variant"
2. Fill variant name: "Test Mango"
3. Click "Upload Image"
4. Select valid image file (< 5MB)
5. Verify preview appears
6. Click "Save"
7. **Expected:** Variant created with image in table

### Test Case 2: Create Variant without Image
1. Click "Add Variant"
2. Fill variant name: "Test Strawberry"
3. Do NOT upload image
4. Click "Save"
5. **Expected:** Variant created with initials fallback

### Test Case 3: File Validation - Invalid Type
1. Click "Upload Image"
2. Select PDF or other non-image file
3. **Expected:** Error message "Please select a valid image file"

### Test Case 4: File Validation - Too Large
1. Click "Upload Image"
2. Select image > 5MB
3. **Expected:** Error message "Image size must be less than 5MB"
