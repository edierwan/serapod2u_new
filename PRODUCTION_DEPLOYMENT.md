## ⚠️ Post-Deployment Notes

### Known Warnings (Non-Critical)
- **Node.js 18 Deprecation Warning** from Supabase
  - Informational only - doesn't affect functionality
  - Consider updating GitHub Actions to use Node.js 20

### Recommended GitHub Actions Update
Update your workflow file to eliminate warnings:

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '20'  # Recommended for Next.js 15
    cache: 'npm'
```
