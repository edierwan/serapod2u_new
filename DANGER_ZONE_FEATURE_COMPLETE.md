## üìù Notes

1. **Testing Environment**: This feature is designed for testing/demo environments. Use with extreme caution in production.

2. **Backup First**: Always export backup before deletion, especially for full reset.

3. **Email Integration**: Email notifications are prepared but require email service setup (SendGrid/AWS SES/Resend).

4. **Super Admin Preservation**: Your Super Admin account is ALWAYS preserved during full reset. You will not be locked out.

5. **System Reference Data**: Countries, states, districts, roles, and organization types are NOT deleted even in full reset (they're system data).

6. **Git Push**: DO NOT push to GitHub until testing is complete and approved.

## üéØ Current Status

**‚úÖ COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING**

All code is written, compiled without errors, and ready for local testing. Please test thoroughly before pushing to GitHub.

**Next Steps:**

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues during testing:
1. Check browser console logs (detailed phase logs)
